# To Do

- Excellent resource: <https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com>
- Use `setfiletype`, not `set filetype=` in the filetype autocommand (not sure which is used currently)
- Will need to use regex for symtax matching. E.g. matching ints and floats as numbers.
  - Do CCs support scientific notation?
